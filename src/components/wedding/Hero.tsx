 * Scene 4 — the couple filling the screen, their names along the foot.
 *
 * The picture is softened by a blur and held under a light warm veil. It began
 * as a pale wash at a fifth opacity, which looked washed out, then went too far
 * the other way into something near black; this sits between, and the softening
 * does the work the darkness was doing.
 *
 * Its foot dissolves rather than stopping: the picture is masked away over the
 * last stretch so it melts into the page instead of ending on a ruled line —
 * which is what the collapsing edge looked like on the way up.
 *
 * Pinned to the top and collapsing as you scroll, the names riding the rising
 * bottom edge, until the section below takes over.
